# SleepApnea
An IOT based project that takes one's oxygen levels and predicts whether one is suffering from sleep apnea

We first fetch reading from the sensor and send it to our local sql server and then fetch the readings 
Into the android application and from there using our ML model we predict the result and display it back to the screen.
